A Patternbook
====

The concept of a **Design Pattern** originated in Christopher Alexander's
[A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language),
which made architectural design more accessible by distilling design
expertise into a catalog of timeless design patterns and documenting
when and how to use these patterns to achieve successful design.
