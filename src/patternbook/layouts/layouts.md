Layouts
----

Depending on the route, a layout is selected.  [Page](/layouts/Page) is
the master layout, rendered for all routes.  Within the page,
one of the following is rendered:

- [Home](/layouts/Home) is used only for the home screen
- [Category](/layouts/Category) is used for any page which serves as
  the index for a group of patterns
- [Pattern](/layouts/Pattern) is used for each pattern, and can include
  examples of usage which can be rendered
