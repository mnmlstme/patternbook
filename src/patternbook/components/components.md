Components
====

Components add interactivity to the otherwise static content
of the patterns pages.

- [Render](/components/Render) is used to render examples
- [Source](/components/Source) is used to present the source code
  of an example
- [Demo](/components/Demo) combines the source code and rendering
  into one coordinated component
