Components
----

Components add interactivity to the otherwise static content
of the patterns pages.

- [Render](/components/Render) is used to render examples
- [Scope](/components/Scope) is used along with `Render` to provide
  test data to the examples
- [Source](/components/Source) is used to present the source code
  of an example
- [Show](/components/Show) combines the source code and rendering
  into one coordinated component
